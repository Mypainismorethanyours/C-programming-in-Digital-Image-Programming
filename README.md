Some basic image fusion algorithms includinf SURF, ORB and STITCH have been implemented with optimization.

SURF is implmented by C++, ORB is implemented by C++ and Python and STITCH is implemented by Python running in Notebbook.

You can see the results and principles and optimization methods in Report.pdf.
